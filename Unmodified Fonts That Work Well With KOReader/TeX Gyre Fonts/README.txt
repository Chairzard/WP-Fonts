This package contains the entire collection of the TeX Gyre fonts, distributed without modification to comply with the font licenses.

 I do NOT recommend using the included version of TeX Gyre Termes, as it has some kerning issues. Instead, I recommend using my modified WP New Times font instead, which fixes these issues. The rest of the collection works well out of the box.

 I also have a customized version of TeX Gyre Cursor called WP Click. The only difference between it and the base font is that ligatures have been removed. If you prefer ligatures, you can use the base version of the font.

 The following fonts also are probably worth avoiding:

 - TeX Gyre Chorus
 - TeX Gyre Heros Cn (the condensed version of the font)

You can install your desired fonts from the .otf files in the "opentype" folder.
