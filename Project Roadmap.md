# Project Roadmap

|Task|Status|
|---|---|
|Upload the highest-priority (most commonly used) fonts|✅ Done|
|Upload the less commonly used fonts|In progress|
|Improve small-caps kerning for certain fonts|This will be done on a case-by-case basis, where it makes sense. Out of the box kerning is sometimes too tight; I'm not 100% sure why this happens. This takes a *lot* of time (I need to manually scale down and adjust the kerning tables/pairs), so fixes aren't planned for many fonts at this time.|
|Link to recommended font download pages/repositories|❌ Not started|
