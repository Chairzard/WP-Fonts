# Project Roadmap

|Task|Status|
|---|---|
|Upload the highest-priority (most commonly used) fonts|✅ Done|
|Link to recommended font download pages/repositories|In progress|
|Improve small-caps kerning for certain fonts|This will be done on a case-by-case basis, where it makes sense. Out of the box kerning is sometimes too tight. Fixing this takes a *lot* of time (more than it's worth, oftentimes), so I'm proritizing more important fonts for this process. As of 1/29/26, I'm eyeing getting this done by the end of the year.|
|Upload the lesser-known/used fonts in my collection|❌ Not started|
