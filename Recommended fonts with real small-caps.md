This list was last updated on 1/22/2026.  

The following fonts which work well on e-ink displays have small capitals already built in, so no modified version is needed to render text correctly in KOReader. If the regular font style is too thin (Baskervvile, Ibarra Real Nova, etc), try increasing the font size and/or using a heavier font weight (instead of using Regular/Italic, you may choose Medium/Medium Italic).  

The first set of fonts listed here come with all 4 style files; these are "the best of the best", in terms of taking advantage of KOReader's full font rendering font capabilities:

Links to project repositories will be added in a future update. Note that *most* of these are available on either Google Fonts or CTAN. For fonts on Google Fonts, I highly encourage you to seek out the font project's repository for the most up-to-date version of the font; Google Fonts can be very slow to update, if it updates at all. CTAN's fonts generally aren't hosted on external repositories.  

The following fonts have 3 files available, but are missing a single style:  

- [Bona Nova](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bona+Nova) - Missing Bold Italic
- [Neuton](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Neuton) - Missing Bold Italic

The following fonts do not have italic styles available. KOReader will apply an oblique effect to text, when a file calls for italics:  

- [Bedstead](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/bedstead)

The following fonts do not have bold styles available. KOReader will apply added weight to the font when the text call for bold text. How good this looks varies wildly; tread with caution, if reading text that uses bold text:  

- [Chapbook](https://www.feorag.com/freestuff/chapbook.html)

The following fonts come in only a single, regular style. Both italics and bold text will have an artificial effect created by KOReader:  

- [Departure Mono](https://github.com/rektdeckard/departure-mono)

The following fonts include small-caps already, but are missing them in one or more styles in the base font files (or their implemenation and/or kerning is broken). I recommend using my modified versions of these fonts for KOReader to ensure your text renders properly:

Another note: These fonts are also ideal for use on Kindle. Kindle, unlike KOReader, *can* create fake small-caps on its own. However, if a font includes real small-caps, it will display those instead. Also, unlike KOReader, Kindle handles fonts missing one or more style files in… unpredictable ways; I only recommend using fonts with all 4 styles on Kindle. Kobo is *terrible* when it comes to text rendering. It *will* at least create fake small caps when a font is missing, but it won't use real ones, if the font has them. Use whatever fonts you want there (no modified versions needed, as a result!). I am unsure about Pocketbook's handling of small caps.
