The following fonts which work well on e-ink displays have small capitals already built in, so no modified version is needed to render text correctly in KOReader. If the regular font style is too thin (Baskervvile, Ibarra Real Nova, etc), try increasing the font size and/or using a heavier font weight (instead of using Regular/Italic, you may choose Medium/Medium Italic).  

Links to project repositories will be added in a future update. Note that *most* of these are available on either Google Fonts or CTAN. For fonts on Google Fonts, I highly encourage you to seek out the font project's repository for the most up-to-date version of the font; Google Fonts can be very slow to update, if it updates at all.
