## Current list of fonts that need kerning optimizations

The fonts listed below have not had their kerning classes scaled down. As a result, kerning on these for the small-cap characters is a bit too tight (how tight depends on the font; the difference may sometimes be almost imperceptible). Not all listed fonts have had their WP font counterparts created, but I have them in my collection and plan to add them after optimizing the kerning. Existing fonts will be re-uploaded, when completed:
