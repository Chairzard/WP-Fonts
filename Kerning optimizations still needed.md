## Current list of fonts that need kerning optimizations

The fonts listed below have not had their kerning classes scaled down. As a result, kerning on these for the small-cap characters is a bit too tight (how tight depends on the font; the difference may sometimes be almost imperceptible). If you wish to see the kerning improved for any of these fonts, please create an ticket in issue tracker and I will see if it's viable to improve these:  

- Cabin
- Chakra Petch
- Comic Neue
- Cooper Hewitt
- Finlandica
- Google Sans
- Gupter
- Inter
- KoHo
- Overpass
- Philosopher
- Recursive Sans Casual
- Recursive Sans Linear
- Reddit Sans
- Rosario
- SUSE

## List of fonts that won't receive kerning optimizations

The following fonts will not receive kerning optimizations (due to technical issues, further refining their kerning isn't viable):

- Grandstander
- Josefin Sans
- Playpen Sans
- Wittgenstein (as per the font maintainer, small caps are currently planned for the font anyway)
